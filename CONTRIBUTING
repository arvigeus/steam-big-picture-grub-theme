The theme consists of a static image with the boot menu being displayed in the left middle part of the screen.

Grub menu width should be 40% of image's width. Avoid using percentages.

Grub menu height is tricky. I tried recreating the theme in CSS and I use values from there. It Works On My Machineâ„¢!
